# TextureKernelNet
This is the code for 'Variable-Scale Acoustic Texture Image and Interpretable Filter Convolutional Networks for Defect Monitoring in Laser Powder Bed Fusion'

# Folder
There are implemented model files in the "./model" folder. 
The original Python implementation of filters such as LM in the "./utils" folder and within the articles.

# Reminder
The learning rate should preferably be kept at 1e-5. Otherwise, epsilon (1e-10) needs to be added to the defined convolution kernel parameters to prevent the denominator from being zero.
