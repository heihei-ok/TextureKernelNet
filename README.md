# Remind
The learning rate should preferably be below 1e-5. Otherwise, the epsilon (1e-10) needs to be added during the parameter descent process to prevent the denominator from being zero.

The original implementation of .utils with texture convolution kernels
.model contains the modular implementation of the model
.Mat_data_process contains the code for converting 1D signals into texture images, and it is implemented in Matlab.
